# policies

These policies are only valid for the official version of ShieldBattery. Forks
or other hosts should provide their own replacements to match their own policies
and usage.

## Update guide

Any updates to these policies should add an entry to the changelog at the
beginning (or add a changelog if one is not yet there) and update the effective
date. \*_Make sure to increment the version number in `versions.ts` as well_, as
this is how users get notified of the changes.
