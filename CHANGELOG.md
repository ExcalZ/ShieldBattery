#### 7.0.19 (July 27, 2021)

- **Support for SC:R 1.23.8.9713.** We've fixed launching multiplayer games on the latest version
  of StarCraft: Remastered. Our improved fix for flying SCVs will still be used in place of
  Blizzard's during gameplay. We also have compatibility code for older replays, so replays
  containing the SCV exploit will continue to play back correctly when viewed through our client.
- **Time travel.** You'll now be able to see the history of chat channels from before you joined
  them. Please only use this power for good, we take no responsibility for users preventing their
  own conception.
- **UI fixes for profiles.** User avatars should now display in the proper color, map thumbnails
  will load a bit more smoothly, and the match history should look a bit nicer if you only have a
  couple games played.

##### Known Issues

- **HD graphics fail to work even when purchased/turned on.** Blizzard requires the game to be
  launched from their launcher once every 30 days to keep premium features enabled. We'll at the
  very least add a warning for this case in the future (or better yet, automate re-authing), but
  for now, try to launch the game from the Blizzard launcher at least once a month.
- **Observer mode missing.** We're still getting our lobby code to work with the newer ingame
  observer things, this will return shortly!
- **Off-center screen starting position.** For some users, generally in positions on the right side
  of the screen, the starting screen position may be slightly off-center from where it usually is.

#### 7.0.18 (July 10, 2021)

- **Profiles are here!** User profiles are now available, accessible from the user menu in chat
  channels as well as the ladder rankings. Check out a user's recent match history, their stats
  with various races, and more! More personalization and statistics coming soon!
- **Start minimized.** When ShieldBattery is set to launch on system startup, you can now make it
  start minimized as well.
- **Clickable names.** Usernames in the various chat experiences (channels, whispers, lobbies) are
  now clickable and will bring up a menu so that you can easily access extra functionality.

##### Known Issues

- **HD graphics fail to work even when purchased/turned on.** Blizzard requires the game to be
  launched from their launcher once every 30 days to keep premium features enabled. We'll at the
  very least add a warning for this case in the future (or better yet, automate re-authing), but
  for now, try to launch the game from the Blizzard launcher at least once a month.
- **Observer mode missing.** We're still getting our lobby code to work with the newer ingame
  observer things, this will return shortly!
- **Off-center screen starting position.** For some users, generally in positions on the right side
  of the screen, the starting screen position may be slightly off-center from where it usually is.

#### 7.0.16 (June 27, 2021)

- **You're grounded.** Fixed an exploit that allowed SCVs and Drones to fly over obstacles if their
  order queue size was exceeded in a specific way. This also fixes some existing mineral hack
  exploits.
- **Launch at startup.** Added an option to launch the ShieldBattery client at system startup
  (defaults to on). You can change this in the 'App' tab of the settings.
- **Ladder table fixes.** Fixed some issues with the ladder rankings table when users had
  particularly long names.

##### Known Issues

- **HD graphics fail to work even when purchased/turned on.** Blizzard requires the game to be
  launched from their launcher once every 30 days to keep premium features enabled. We'll at the
  very least add a warning for this case in the future (or better yet, automate re-authing), but
  for now, try to launch the game from the Blizzard launcher at least once a month.
- **Observer mode missing.** We're still getting our lobby code to work with the newer ingame
  observer things, this will return shortly!
- **Off-center screen starting position.** For some users, generally in positions on the right side
  of the screen, the starting screen position may be slightly off-center from where it usually is.
- **Replays sometimes crash on startup.** With newer versions of SC:R (9651+), replays occasionally
  crash as soon as they load. This is a transient issue, and not specific to any particular replay,
  so relaunching the same replay should work.

#### 7.0.15 (June 8, 2021)

- **Support for new SC:R version.** We're now compatible with 1.23.8.9588. If you'd like to play on
  this version and actually have autoscrolling chat, we've got you covered!
- **More visible notifications.** Notifications now pop up in the client when they're first
  delivered, so you can actually notice they've arrived. More notifications for useful things, as
  well as OS-level notifications are coming soon!
- **More interactive buttons.** Buttons should appear a bit more dynamic and fun in this release.
- **Ya blue it.** We've moved to a blue-ier color scheme in this release, to bring out a more "cool
  sci-fi" vibe and less "trendy office app". We're sure you'll feel right at home.
- **More visible hotkeys.** Activity buttons on the main screen now underline the character that
  matches their hotkey, for easier discoverability. Just add alt!

#### 7.0.12 (May 14, 2021)

- **No more idling.** The ladder rankings now display when a user last played a game, so you can
  get a better idea of who you're likely to catch in the queue, and who's just sitting at the top
  hoping not to lose their rank.
- **Chat improvements.** We've fixed a bunch of bugs related to scrolling and loading more messages
  in chat and whispers, and added a message when days change between messages (no more getting
  confused replying to that whisper from a week ago!)
- **Load time improvements.** The game now loads a bit less unnecessary data, which should bring
  the game start time down on slower systems.
- **Beefier fonts.** We've fixed some issues with font rendering, so a number of components should
  have thicker fonts as intended.
- **More efficient menus.** We know SC players love efficiency, so we've changed our small overlays
  (menus, profile popups, etc.) to allow you to click things behind them while they're open. This
  should make it a bit less annoying to navigate things with a lot of menus.
- **Crash fix.** We've fixed a rare crash that could occur with some hardware/software
  configurations on Nvidia graphics cards.

#### 7.0.10 (April 16, 2021)

- **Can you hear me now?** Application sounds are now 150% louder, as they were a bit quiet relative
  to other application's volumes. You may want to double-check your settings to ensure they sound
  how you'd like.
- **Replay filenames.** Auto-saved replays from ShieldBattery now contain the correct map name
  instead of just 'map'.
- **Calm down, minerals.** Minerals and gas geysers should no longer vibrate in replays. Sorry, they
  were just a bit excited.
- **Au revoir.** We made a change to ensure the game never tries to talk to the Bonjour service,
  which may have been stalling some users' game initialization in rare cases.
- **Blink. blink.** The application will now flash its taskbar entry when someone joins your lobby.
- **Longer load times.** We've doubled the allowable game load times (to 60 seconds) since some
  users were hitting this timeout when they would have loaded successfully. We have some plans to
  improve this system to not require such long timeouts, but these players should no longer be
  hindered by it for the time being.
- **Ping pong.** We've revamped our system for dealing with game servers, allowing us to add and
  remove servers on the fly, as well as improving the consistent and reliability of clients
  calculating their ping to the various regions. This should improve ingame latency a bit (more
  work on that front coming soon!).

##### Known Issues

- **HD graphics fail to work even when purchased/turned on.** Blizzard requires the game to be
  launched from their launcher once every 30 days to keep premium features enabled. We'll at the
  very least add a warning for this case in the future (or better yet, automate re-authing), but
  for now, try to launch the game from the Blizzard launcher at least once a month.
- **Observer mode missing.** We're still getting our lobby code to work with the newer ingame
  observer things, this will return shortly!
- **Off-center screen starting position.** For some users, generally in positions on the right side
  of the screen, the starting screen position may be slightly off-center from where it usually is.

#### 7.0.9 (April 9th, 2021)

- **Faster auto-update.** Our updates are now served from our global CDN and support downloading
  just the parts of the app that have actually been updated. Basically, these should download a lot
  faster now.
- **Smoother fullscreen.** We've tweaked how the game handles fullscreen mode to work better with
  multiple monitors and removed some legacy code it was still using. If you're on Windows 10 and
  have been using Fullscreen (Windowed) mode, we highly recommend checking out normal Fullscreen
  now: it should work nearly the same as far as program switching goes, but with improved
  performance and input latency. This change has some potential to cause problems for users on
  older graphics card, so if you see any weirdness, please let us know!
- **Browse maps in less clicks.** Our map browser now lets you view details about a particular map
  by clicking on its tile, rather than needing to go through menus. In addition, there should be
  less things jumping around as the map images load in (we'll try to work some click accuracy
  training back into the client in some other way üòè).

##### Known Issues

- **HD graphics fail to work even when purchased/turned on.** Blizzard requires the game to be
  launched from their launcher once every 30 days to keep premium features enabled. We'll at the
  very least add a warning for this case in the future (or better yet, automate re-authing), but
  for now, try to launch the game from the Blizzard launcher at least once a month.
- **Observer mode missing.** We're still getting our lobby code to work with the newer ingame
  observer things, this will return shortly!
- **Off-center screen starting position.** For some users, generally in positions on the right side
  of the screen, the starting screen position may be slightly off-center from where it usually is.
- **Vibrating mineral patches.** You're not going crazy, I promise. Those mineral patches really are
  vibrating. This is an unintentional side-effect of our fog of war change for some users, we're
  working on it!

#### 7.0.6 (April 2nd, 2021)

- **Skins!** Our settings dialog now has options for selecting the various types of skins in the
  game (both console + building/unit ones). We have no way of verifying what you have or haven't
  purchased so they're all shown, but if you select one you don't have access to, you'll get normal
  graphics. (Same known issues apply as with HD graphics here: you must launch SC:R with the
  Blizzard launcher every 30 days to refresh your purchase information.)
- **Links and stuff.** We've added a menu containing links to our various other web presences
  (Discord, GitHub, Patreon, etc.). Access it by clicking on the ShieldBattery logo in the top left
  of the client.
- **No more feedback.** Society has progressed past the need for feedback. We've removed the link
  to the feedback form in the app. ShieldBattery is already perfect! Just kidding, we just prefer
  that you direct your feedback and bug reports to our Discord so we can more easily collect
  additional information when necessary (check out the link to it in our snazzy new menu if you're
  not already there!)
- **Various fixes and polish.** The standalone client should no longer put links underneath the
  window controls where you can't click them, our map browser tabs are a bit less redundant,
  standalone web clients will go to the login page by default if logged out, and probably more
  small things!

##### Known Issues

- **HD graphics fail to work even when purchased/turned on.** Blizzard requires the game to be
  launched from their launcher once every 30 days to keep premium features enabled. We'll at the
  very least add a warning for this case in the future (or better yet, automate re-authing), but

  vibrating. This is an unintentional side-effect of our fog of war change for some users, we're
  working on it!

#### 7.0.5 (March 26th, 2021)

- **You're bad.** Or maybe you're good, now you can find out on our new ranked leaderboard! Find
  the Ladder button or hit Alt+D on your keyboard to bring it up and check out how you stack up
  against the rest of the server. More information like main races, game history, and in depth
  user profiles coming soon.
- **More counting!** We now have a snazzy counter for the number of games played on our
  <a href="https://shieldbattery.net/splash" target="_blank">home page</a>. If you've ever wanted the privilege of making a counter go up just from clicking a few buttons, come play a few games!
- **But also less counting!** We've turned off the counter showing how many people are currently
  queued for matchmaking. We found it made people less likely to queue and overall gave them
  incorrect expectations for how long finding a match would take. We're working on some better ways
  to give people realistic expectations here, and should have some more to share soon.
- **Notifications.** We've added support for in-client notifications. At the moment there aren't
  very many of these, but you'll notice a new button in the bottom right to access them. The
  settings button is still there as well, just a little smaller than before (please don't talk
  about it, wouldn't want to embarrass the button).
- **Another round of UI polish.** Our client got another round of UI polish changing the look of...
  just about everything really. Tweaks to text styles, larger click targets, adjustments to chat
  layout and more!
- **Rare launch bugs squashed.** We fixed some more issues that we saw happen to a few users on
  game launch. If you were having trouble before, try again, it might be better now! If not, we'll
  keep working at it.
- **Like small windows?** Well, now you can use them, I guess? The client should behave more
  reasonably at small sizes now, no more losing important buttons outside the visible area.
- **Pesky high ranked players.** We've made some more tweaks to how our matchmaker finds potential
  opponents for high ranked players to try and keep queue times a bit more reasonable.

##### Known Issues

- **HD graphics fail to work even when purchased/turned on.** Blizzard requires the game to be
  launched from their launcher once every 30 days to keep premium features enabled. We'll at the
  very least add a warning for this case in the future (or better yet, automate re-authing), but
  for now, try to launch the game from the Blizzard launcher at least once a month.
- **Observer mode missing.** We're still getting our lobby code to work with the newer ingame
  observer things, this will return shortly!
- **Off-center screen starting position.** For some users, generally in positions on the right side
  of the screen, the starting screen position may be slightly off-center from where it usually is.
- **Vibrating mineral patches.** You're not going crazy, I promise. Those mineral patches really are
  vibrating. This is an unintentional side-effect of our fog of war change for some users, we're
  working on it!

#### 7.0.3 (March 19th, 2021)

- **We learned to count.** The lobby count should be a bit more accurate now and stop telling you
  about lobbies that have already started.
- **Emails, emails, emails.** Email verification should be working again (try your existing emails
  again, but resending emails should also work).

#### 7.0.2 (March 19th, 2021)

- **Some random changes.** Or, well, changes for Random players. Players who have selected Random
  will no longer be able to choose an alternate race. This didn't really work how most people
  expected (it picked the alternate only if your opponent was also playing Random), so we fixed the
  glitch.
- **Stacks on stacks on stacks.** Buildings and resources that are stacked on top of each other
  (for instance, stacked neutral buildings or stacked mineral patches) now display a stack count in
  their unit card.
- **We heard you liked numbers.** The matchmaking and lobby buttons will now display a count of
  active players or lobbies, so you can figure out how badly you want to join. (Really badly, I'm
  sure).
- **More selective matches.** We fixed a bug in the matchmaker that was letting it pick matches that
  only one player was happy with. Now you all have to be happy about every match you're given. I do
  not make the rules. The matchmaker does, but it's been super benevolent so far...
- **Anti-anti-virus.** ShieldBattery will now alert you if someone or something has deleted
  important files (I'm looking at you, anti-virus makers). This can often be remedied by reporting
  it as a false positive or removing the file from quarantine.
- **Bugs bashed.** Fixed a game crash that could occur if you hadn't launched SC:R once after
  installing it. Fixed our chat channels and whispers showing notifications for non-existent
  messages. Improved the performance of chat channels with large numbers of users.

##### Known Issues

- **HD graphics fail to work even when purchased/turned on.** Blizzard requires the game to be
  launched from their launcher once every 30 days to keep premium features enabled. We'll at the
  very least add a warning for this case in the future (or better yet, automate re-authing), but
  for now, try to launch the game from the Blizzard launcher at least once a month.

  of the screen, the starting screen position may be slightly off-center from where it usually is.
- **Vibrating mineral patches.** You're not going crazy, I promise. Those mineral patches really are
  vibrating. This is an unintentional side-effect of our fog of war change for some users, we're
  working on it!

#### 7.0.1 (March 13th, 2021)

- **Game loading... or not.** We've fixed a number of issues around players leaving or getting
  disconnected during game loads/countdowns in both matchmaking and lobbies. Previously these could
  leave the server in a pretty weird state and potentially prevent you from joining more matches in
  the future.
- **tec27 has come online. tec27 has gone offline. tec27 has come online.** We've turned online and
  offline messages off in chat for the moment, as they were being pretty obnoxious. In the future
  we might make this a configurable option (although depending on how this feels, this might just
  be how it is! Feedback welcome!).
- **Zombies eradicated.** StarCraft should do a better job of exiting if it failed to launch a game,
  no more creepy zombie clients hanging around in the background.
- **Logs. The text kind, not the wood kind.** Accessing our clients log files for reporting issues
  is now a lot easier! Right-click the icon in your system tray and find that shiny, new
  "Open Logs Folder" action. We've also added a bunch of other diagnostic logging around
  connections and game launching and such, so hopefully we can track down a few more of those
  pesky launch issues. (And if you _are_ having launch issues, sending us your logs in our
  <a href="https://discord.gg/S8dfMx94a4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a> would be very
  helpful!)

##### Known Issues

  vibrating. This is an unintentional side-effect of our fog of war change for some users, we're
  working on it!

#### 7.0.0 (March 11th, 2021)

- **Wow, it's been a while.** Sorry about that. The hurdles involved in supporting a game that was
  actively being worked on were unexpected and large. But we figured it out! And we're here again!
  And we're ready to bring you the best gosh darn StarCrafting Experience you've ever seen!
- **StarCraft: Resupported.** We now support StarCraft: Remastered installs. In fact, that's all we
  support. RIP 1.16, we'll miss you a bit. As a result, you'll notice that our Settings dialog has
  changed quite a bit, and we directly map to settings you'd find inside SC:R now. The big missing
  feature there is hotkey configuration. For now, you can launch SC:R through Blizzard's launcher
  and any hotkeys you change there will be maintained for ShieldBattery.
- **We're open for business!** No more invite process, this is now an open beta. Tell your friends,
  children, parents, pets... Get em all in here.
- **Matchmaking making matches.** Matchmaking is finally here! For 1v1. Without visible ranks yet.
  More modes (teams!) and visible ranks are coming real soon, but we wanted to roll out a simpler
  version first to work out all the kinks. It'll be available on weekends only for the first
  couple weeks, and we'll play it by ear after that. The client will let you know if it's down (and
  also let you know when it'll be back if it's currently disabled)! We look forward to your feedback on our unique race and map selection systems, so let us have it!
- **DeMapcracy.** Remember that cool new maps backend we mentioned 3 years ago? Honestly I wouldn't
  blame you if you didn't, although I mean, it's like, two versions below this one and you could
  just go look... Okay you don't have to, really it's fine! The important thing is, you can now
  upload all those maps you have sitting in your BW directory. And you can make lobbies for them
  too! Currently these will be in your _private collection_, usable only by you. Features for
  publishing and managing publicly available maps are _Coming Soon‚Ñ¢_.
- **Fog of War: Now With Slightly Less Fog.** The starting fog color is now slightly transparent in
  non-UMS settings, so you can see the location of terrain and resources without exploring. We
  believe this will make playing new and unfamiliar maps slightly less intimidating, and just feels _right_. It may be 2021, but we can still teach Brood War some new tricks üòé
- **WHAT'S THAT? I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE COUNTDOWN BEEPS!** We added a volume slider for our
  in-app sounds, just in case you didn't want to blast your whole neighborhood with incessant
  beeping every time you start a game. Weirdo.
- **Donation station.** Much requested: we now have some ways you can contribute to the maintenance
  and hosting costs of all of this. Check out our
  <a href="https://shieldbattery.net/faq" target="_blank">FAQ page</a> for the links.
- **More server locations.** Speaking of donations, thanks to some generous contributors we've
  already been able to expand our game server locations. In addition to the already existing
  EU Central, US East, and US West servers, we now have servers in Korea (Seoul),
  Australia (Sydney), Brazil (S√£o Paulo), and Sweden (Stockholm). Hopefully that brings a few more
  of you into a nice, low-latency experience.

##### Known Issues

- **HD graphics fail to work even when purchased/turned on.** Blizzard requires the game to be
  launched from their launcher once every 30 days to keep premium features enabled. We'll at the
  very least add a warning for this case in the future (or better yet, automate re-authing), but
  for now, try to launch the game from the Blizzard launcher at least once a month.
- **Observer mode missing.** We're still getting our lobby code to work with the newer ingame
  observer things, this will return shortly!

#### 6.1.0 (April 24th, 2017)

- **Support for newer game installs.** We can now handle installs of newer versions of StarCraft
  than 1.16.1! We're of the opinion that 1.18 would be a downgrade for existing ShieldBattery users,
  so we won't actually be using that yet, but we do support transparently converting newer
  installations back to a pristine 1.16.1 copy automatically (without affecting your installation in
  any way). Feel free to point things to your updated copy in the settings, and/or stop having to
  maintain two separate installations just to use our service.
- **When did you join this channel?** Now you can easily see! There is now a line in chat that
  indicates when you connected to the channel, so you can easily see how people change their demeanor
  when you're around.
- **In your face, user.** If you try to launch the app when it's already running the background, the
  original app will actually be brought to the front now.
- **BÃà√©tteÃãr character support.** Users with non-latin characters in their Windows usernames should
  have a 1000x better time launching games now. As in they'll actually work again. Whoops.
- **FAQ accuracy.** The FAQ has been updated to be more accurate towards our actual requirements,
  as well as to provide a link to the (Now free! Now working with ShieldBattery!) Brood War download.

#### 6.0.0 (April 3rd, 2017)

- **Maps. Again. But better.** We've been hard at work implementing a new maps backend that can be
  used to upload and play any maps during lobby creation. It's not quite ready for use by everyone,
  but it now backs all of our official maps (you'll probably notice that map thumbnails look nicer
  and are more consistent, and that some maps have different titles between the selection and lobby
  screen). Expect this upload ability to come in a near-future update! Along with this, we've added a
  few more requested maps: Camelot (from ASL), Judgment Day, and Mizu de Chaud.
- **Lobby actions.** Adding computers just wasn't enough, so we finally threw in some more options
  for all you lobby enthusiasts out there. Try not to get _too_ into it as you close slots, or kick
  or ban players from your lobbies, you do need _some_ opposing players to start the game.
- **UMS.** If you've ever wanted to trade freedom of controlling your own settings for the thrill
  of playing a completely different game inside of Brood War, do we have exciting news for you! Use
  Map Settings maps are now supported on ShieldBattery! The maps we provide for now are: BGH 3.0 (a
  version of BGH that randomly assigns teams), Micro Tournament, Mini-Game Party, Monopoly, Poker D
  NovaX2, Random Micro Arena, SoG - Random, TMA Legends, i S k U Bound, Dhoom 2 Bound, and TriX Bound.
  This is all backed by our new maps backend, as well, so you'll soon be able to play whatever UMS
  maps you want. These won't currently display the pre-game briefing screen, but we're working on that
  as well.
- **System tray icon.** Our standalone client has one now, and will go there when you hit the close
  button. If that weren't enough, its icon will also change when you've received a new message (it's
  still pretty unintelligent though, better notifications with nickname highlighting and sounds and
  other such niceties are coming very soon!).
- **Saved window position.** We installed some additional memory modules in our windowed mode
  mainframe, meaning it can now save and restore your Brood War window's position between games!
- **Username and password recovery.** No longer will you have to PM an admin to recover your lost
  or forgotten account info! It's 2017, so we've built this functionality right into the login form.
  Please don't PM admins any more. Please. I mean, unless it's about something more interesting than
  resetting TamponZerg's password for the 15th time.
- **Window titles.** We made our window titles differ from stock Brood War, so that it's easier to
  configure streaming programs to work specifically for ShieldBattery. You may have to adjust your
  streaming configuration, depending on how you had it set up. The window title will also change
  between game initialization and actual gameplay, to help avoid switching scenes before things are
  ready.
- **OpenGL full screen fixes.** Some previous updates introduced a bug that caused the task bar to
  never get hidden in OpenGL full screen mode. It seems some people actually like using the bottom
  part of their screen or something, so we fixed that. We still recommend DirectX for everyone who can
  use it, but if you need to use OpenGL for compatibility reasons, it should work a bit better now.
- **Chat scrolling fixes.** Our auto-scrolling code used to be a bit picky about who it would work
  for, but we gave it a nice, stern talking to. It should be cool with everyone now.
- **Enhanced game launch failures.** If your game is failing to launch (should be incredibly rare!),
  we've implemented some additional logging. If this is happening to you, please reach out to an admin
  so we can collect this data and get some proper fixes in.
